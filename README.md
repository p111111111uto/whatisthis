  # WHATISTHIS

This Python program helps you easily distinguish similar-looking letters in any phrase you enter, such as L and I or 0 and O. It works by converting each ambiguous character to a more recognizable form â€” either by reversing its case or replacing it with a clearer version.

## Usage

1. Install the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/p111111111uto/whatisthis.git
```

2. After it's installed, run the following command in terminal (depending on your version of Python, you may need to use `python3` instead of `python`):
```bash
python3 whatisthis.py
```
